# Data Structures

### When the **Data** becomes **Information**
The data is just a collection of characters, but after processing it, it becames an information.  
Example :  
+ Data => ananazm si eman ym
+ Information =>  my name is mzanana
After reversing the data it becomes information.

**Data Structure** gives us the way to struct the data to appropriately manage it so it can be an information and used **efficiently**.

### Types of data structures
+ **Linear data structure** when all the elements are arranged in a linear order like **array,  Queue, Stack or linked list.** 
+ **Non linear data structure** when all the elements are not arranged in a linear order like the **Tree** or the **Graph**.

## Time Complexity
### The ideal data structure
**Efficiently** data structure is always measured in term of **TIME** and **Space**.  
The **Ideal** data structure is the one that takes the least possible time for all its operations and consume the least memory space.  

Let's focus on the **Time Complexity**  
The comparison of the time complexity of the data structures based on the operations performed on them,  measuring the actual running time is not practical at all.

#### The running time depends on the **size of inputs**
Let's take an example where we have a table of 1000 integer and we want to add a new number to the beginning of the array, we have to make 1000 shift to the left to have a place to the new number, so that's cause **1000  units of time**.  
#### Time complexity function f(n)
If the size of the input is n, then **f(n)** is a function indicate the **time complexity**,  it represents the number of instructions executed for the input value n.  
We are interested in **growth rate of f(n)**  
Let's take an example of `f(n) = 5n^2 + 6n + 12`

</p>

We notice from the graph of the function that for **larger** value of `n`, the squared term consume almost 99%  of time. So there is no harm if we eliminate the rest of the terms.  
So the approximate time complexity is **`f(n) = 5n^2`** 
### Big O notation 
Big O notation is used to measure the performance of any algorithm by providing the order of growth of the function, it helps us finding the **growth rate** of the function without plugging in different values of N.  

If f(n) and g(n) are two functions, then :  
**f(n) = O(g(n))**  
If there exists constants c and a such that 
**f(n) <= c.g(n) , for all n > a**

Example :

Big O notation eliminates all the unnecessary terms from the function which are not contributing much in the overall running time

### Structures 
We have to get data for a cars as engine, fuel_type, seating_cap ...   
as you notice that the data here had different types. We need to have 10 variable of char * for engine, 10 others for the fuel type, 10 other integer data type for the seating cap ... This is just waste of the memory and having a long code.   
#### Why not having one data type that contain the whole information of the car.

A **structure** is a user defined data type that can be used to group elements of different types into a single type.  
**why not using arrays ?**  
Arrays also can be used to store a group of elements, but with the **same** type!   

**Syntax of a structure**   
<p align = "center">

</p>
 
+ `s_car` is the struct tag and used to identify a particular kind of struct, without `typedef` we need to declare our variable using : `struct s_car car1, car2, ... ;`   
+ `typedef` gives the user the ability to edit any type name, for example `typedef int INTEGER` so from now on we can declare a variable using `INTEGER x;` in our case to not declare our variable `struct s_car car1;` we can declare it just using `t_car car1;`  

 **Access the members** using dot `.`  

```C
typedef struct s_test
{
	int       x;
	char      *str;
}t_test;

int main()
{
	t_test t1, t2;

	t1.x = 14;
	t2.str = "Hello world";
	
}
```

 **Access the members** of a struct pointer using array sign  `->`  
 ```C
typedef struct s_test
{
	int       x;
	char      *str;
}t_test;

int main()
{
	t_test t1 = {25, "Hello world"};
	t_test *pt1;

	pt1 = &t1;
	printf(" %d ", pt1->x);
	// the output in our case is : 25
}
```

`pt1->x` is equivalent to `(*pt1).x` which is `(*&t1).x` that refers to `t1.x`  that equal 25.
