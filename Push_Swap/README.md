# Data Structures

### When the **Data** becomes **Information**
The data is a just a collection of characters, but after processing it became an information.  
Example :  
+ Data -> ananazm si eman ym
+ Information ->  my name is mzanana
After reversing the data it becomes information.

**Data Structure** gives us the way to struct the data to appropriately manage it so it can be an information and used **efficiently**.

### Types of data structures
+ **Linear data structure** when all the elements are arranged in a linear order like **array,  Queue, Stack or linked list.
+ **Non linear data structure** when all the elements are not arranged in a linear order like the **Tree** and the **Graph**.

### The ideal data structure
Efficiently data structure is always measured in term of **TIME** and **Space**.  
The **Ideal** data structure is the one that takes the least possible time for all its operations and consume the least memory space.
