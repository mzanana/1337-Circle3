# Data Structures

### When the **Data** becomes **Information**
The data is a just a collection of characters, but after processing it became an information.  
Example :  
+ Data -> ananazm si eman ym
+ Information ->  my name is mzanana
After reversing the data it becomes information.

**Data Structure** gives us the way to struct the data to appropriately manage it so it can be an information and used **efficiently**.
